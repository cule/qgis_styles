# Lord of the Rings QGIS style collection

The styles are created by using QGIS and for some raster markers and effects also Photoshop was used.
The collection includes:

The background paper style: lotr_paper

The coastline: lotr_shoreline (offset of lines can be either negative or positive depending whether you are using the land or sea to create the shoreline).

The mashland: lotr_marshland

The forest: lotr_forests

The rivers: lotr_river

The roads: lotr_roads

The cities: lotr_cities

The highlands: lotr_highlands

The three different mountain styles to use as separate images.
The image for the north arrow: north arrow.png

To use the styles with raster images, you need to change the folder path of the images in the xml file.


The font style Aniron can be downloaded from here: https://www.1001fonts.com/lord-of-the-rings-fonts.html 

You can use highland fill pattern for mountainous areas but it might give a better effect to use the mountain symbols as inserted pictures in QGIS Layout Manager.
Some of the layers are duplicated or buffered to create more smooth effect. For example, forest areas are created with 4 duplicate layer with different marker sizes and horizontal/vertical displacements. This gives more natural random forest pattern then repeating the same marker with similar pattern.
